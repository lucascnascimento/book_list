## What I Learned

This was my first project coding with a object oriented approach in JavaScript. There are two different custom javascript files. The first one, app.js, deals with objects using ES5 conventions, like prototypes. The second file, appES6.js, deals with it using the most recent approach, i.e., creating classes and instantiating objects from them. To see them in use simply comment the respective script tags in the index.html file.
